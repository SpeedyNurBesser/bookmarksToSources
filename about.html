            <p>
              You are telling me, that there are people who click on an about page of a browser extension, they will probably only use a couple of times a year?
            </p>

            <p><i>
              Exactly, and after having read all about how your name is <a href="https://speedynurbesser.github.io">Ole370</a> and how you have written a couple of <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/18801257/">other browser extensions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/speedynurbesser">programs</a> and even <a href="https://speedynurbesser.github.io/blog">blog posts</a>, they will donate you all their money.
            </i></p>

            <p>
              Are you serious? This seems too good to be true. And you know what they say about something that sounds too good be true...
            </p>

            <p><i>
              I don't know. How should I even know? I mean, I am just you and you are just me. So, I could never know anything you don't know. I am quite literally the voice in your head.
            </i></p>

            <p>
              So, you have been lying to me all this time?
            </p>

            <p><i>
              Not necessarily, for do you know what is the great thing about something you do not know?
            </i></p>

            <p>
              What should there be good about not knowing something? I thought knowledge is power!
            </p>

            <p><i>
              The great thing is that you get to learn and learning is maybe the one thing that is better than knowing. And how do we learn most unknown things?
            </i></p>

            <p>...</p>

            <p><i>
              Right, via trial-and-error! So, we should just try and see, if they will check out <a href="https://speedynurbesser.github.io">your website</a>.

            <p>Our website can't even check, where a user came from!</p>
